# VoiceToggle-LagReductionPlugin
Allows you to mute the in-game voice, and prevent a bug that causes high CPU usage.

**Why would you do this, you ask?**

The game currently has a bug which causes high CPU usage with 3 or more players due to the voice communication. If you experience this issue, this mod will likely help you out. However you'll no longer be able to talk with other players. Perhaps use the <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/jMUSH2j">Jet Island Discord</a> instead?

Also, maybe you don't like the constant voice communication, and want to disable it entirely.
